# ESCLUB
Student clubs website for ESTÃœ. 

There are too many clubs in our university and there is not much information about these clubs on our university website.

We aimed to make a website where all the clubs are together.

In addition, we have the opportunity to see what events these clubs do during the year on this site.

We bring you the platform where you can get more information.

You can access our website [here](https://emregunbak.github.io/esclub/).
